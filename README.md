## The short story
I like what Terry Pratchett callled in one book of his  "The Science of Discworld" sub-series: The narrativum. This element ensure everyone that everything what happens is accordant to the story.
So, let me show you a short tale:


> _Hi, I am Bill,
>I am the tech blogger in "Thlskjdi" press company and I am in trouble.  I need to very fast write a blog about new super hyped javascript library. If I'l fail, my boss Jack fires me. 
I dont't know anything about this library. I need to learn fast. I need coffee. But coffee may not give me required boost...  I know! I should have a phone number to a drug dealer I met on last party... yes, drugs can help me to be more efficient, focused and allow me to learn faster.

>
>But Bill didn't notice that he has been following by a policeman. After short time the police will know ewerything about Bill and they catch him. 
Will he write the post and send it to the Jack befere the cops come into his flat?
